            <h2>What Are Natural Dyes?</h2>
            <p>Early natural dyers - dating back to, at least, the advent of agriculture over 12,000 years ago - likely
               discovered their colors through cooking. Madder, weld, indigo, and walnut were recorded as known
               dyestuffs by
               the end of the first century BCE.
               Synthetic dyes became readily available as a cheaper, faster alternative to traditional dye techniques in
               the
               late 1800s. Natural dye processes faded into relative obscurity. As artists shift their interests toward
               a
               return to slower, more thoughtful processes, natural dye is seeing a resurgence in popularity. </p>

            <h2>A Simple Dye Project</h2>
            <h4>Onion Skin Dye Bath</h4>
            <p>One of the easiest, most reliable first projects for new dyers is an onion skin dye bath. Not only are onion skins easily accessible (save them up or ask your local grocery of you can collect them), but they also do not require your fabric to be mordanted because they contain chemical components like tannins. Mordanting is the process of treating your fabric or other materials prior to dyeing. The mordant acts as a binding agent between your dye particles and your fabric, ensuring strong, washfast colors. </p>
            <ol>
               <li>Gather your supplies</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>A non-reactive stock pot&#8212;if you want to try more with dyes, get a stock pot that will no longer be used for food preparation</li>
                  <li>Onion skins&#8212;the more you use, the deeper your color will be)</li>
                  <li>Something to dye&#8212;Find a white shirt or bandana made of 100% natural materials</li>
                  <li>A water source&#8212;make sure to use enough water that your fabric can freely float around</li>
                  <li>A stirring tool&#8212;I use 1/2" wooden dowels</li>
                  <li>A heat source</li>
                  <li>pH neutral soap&#8212;clear Dawn dish soap is great for this</li>
                  <li>(optional) A collander or skimmer to remove your onion skins later </li>
               </ul>
               <li>Extract your dye! Add the onion skins to your pot and fill half to three-quarters of the way with water. Turn on the heat and allow your water to come up to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Maintain that simmer for at least 45 minutes (you can also cook longer or turn off the heat and let the dye continue to "steep" overnight, reheating before use). Then, strain or scoop out as much of the onion skins as you can. 
               </li> 
               <li>Soak your fabric in water for at least 30 minutes before dyeing for the most consisitent color. Then squeeze out the bulk of the water and slowly lower into your dyebath. Gently poke and stir the fabric to make sure that your color can access every part of the fabric. To speed up the dye process, you can keep your dye pot on the heat and maintain a bare simmer.</li> 
               <li>When you are happy with your color (note: your fabric will be a few shades lighter when dry), allow to cool, squeeze out the excess dye, and begin to rinse out your fabric. Start with cool water, increase to warm or hot, and use your pH neutral soap until the water runs clear. Dry and enjoy!</li>
               <li>Bonus: There is plenty of pigment left in your dye pot. Each subsequent piece of fabric will achieve a lighter color until the dye is exhausted. This is a great time to experiment with modifiers. Separate your remaining dye into a few small containers (mason jars are great, because you can see what's happening in the dye) and add a little piece of fabric to each. In one, throw in a few rusty nails. In another, squeeze some lemon or add a dash of vinegar. In a third, add some baking soda. You'll see the color change based on the changes in pH or addition of iron.</li>

            <h2>A Note About Indigo</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Indigo has become one of my favorite dye materials over the last few years. It has an incredible history, dating back more than 5,000 years and is found in the history of cultures all across the world. Indigo pigment (indican) is derived from the Indigo plant (Indigofera Tinctoria) and requires special processes to be extracted, fermented, and used for dyes. Rather than steeping the indigo in simmering water, it must be mixed in a fermentation vat fed with sugars (think of it like a sourdough starter). A properly maintained vat can be used continuously for months, if not years. The dye vat itself is clear liquid ranging in color from lime green to yellow-brown. Slowly stir to re-activate, let it sit, then slower in your fabric. When you raise your fabric back out, it will be a brilliant, bright green. Over time, the green will oxidize and turn into the bright blue you expect. To darken your shade of blue, continue to dip your fabric and let it oxidize. Each dip will deepen the color. Indigo is a color and dye process unlike any other. I love teaching it to friends because the process is truly magical.</p>
